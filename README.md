# Modeling NHL Player Contracts using their Prior Season's Stats
During the 2019 NHL off-season, 91 forwards signed contracts. My team recorded the length and total value of these contracts. In addition, we made note of the players' individual hockey statistics from the previous season. Our goal was to model the cap hit of these contracts using the statistics we collected. Our response variable was the annual salary in millions of American dollars. We considered ten candidate regressors. In the end, we created a multiple linear regression model that used only the most important regressors. We utilized model building and regression techniques such as Box-Cox transformations, random forests, Mallow's Cp statistic, as well as many others to create the best possible model.

## PLEASE NOTE:
Pages 1-11 contain the actual report, while pages 12-45 contain the appendix which contains the resources used as well as the R code used to create the model.
